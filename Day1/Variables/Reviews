Review 1:
Cognitive complexity is 5
Solution : Use a HashSet or Use switch Expression

Review 3:
Cognitive complexity is high = 12 dues to multiple nesting of if else statements.
 
1.	Simplify Conditionals: Reduce the number of nested if statements by handling base cases and negative cases early.
2.	Use Iteration Instead of Recursion: Replace the recursive approach with an iterative one to avoid deep call stacks and improve performance.
3.	Early Returns: Use early returns for base cases to make the code more readable and reduce nesting.

Review 5:
Use an enumeration and directly compare the userRole with the enumeration value in the conditional statement
Benefits: code quality, readability, and maintainability.

Review 4: 
-Unnecessary .Count() in the loop condition[ Use .Count or .Length outside the loop]
-Unclear variable name (li) [Use a more descriptive name]
-Declare Variables Close to Their Usage [Move Dispatch(li); closer to where li is first used]
 
  Refactored Code:
  var cities = new[] { "Austin", "New York", "San Francisco" };
  int cityCount = cities.Length; // Store length once
  for (int i = 0; i < cityCount; i++)
  {
      DoStuff();
      DoSomeOtherStuff();
      string city = cities[i];
      Dispatch(city);
  }

Review 5:
Use an enumeration and directly compare the userRole with the enumeration value in the conditional statement
Benefits: code quality, readability, and maintainability.

Review 9:
Cognitive complexity is 2
Solution: Use ?? (Null-Coalescing Operator)
